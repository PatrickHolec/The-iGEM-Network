This script was designed to circumvent the denied request for the full list of Biobricks on the Standard Registry of Biological Parts.

This script will travel through every Biobrick from every single iGEM team page from every year, and return a list of this data.

You should be able to run the script- it takes about 24 hrs of running to access every single existing page on the registry.

Because of this delay, we decided to attach with the full list in case you just want the results.
